## Features

- Pandoc/Quarto-flavoured Markdown — tables, strikethrough, footnotes, task lists, fenced code blocks
- **LaTeX math** — inline `$...$` and display `$$...$$` rendered via KaTeX (requires internet; graceful fallback when offline)
- View / Edit toggle — rendered Markdown preview or raw text editor, switch instantly; scroll position preserved when switching
- Collapsible lists — any bullet or numbered item with children gets a ▶/▼ toggle; click to collapse/expand; toolbar buttons for collapse all / expand all
- Ctrl+Scroll to zoom font size (6–72 pt)
- Word wrap toggle
- **Inline formatting shortcuts** — `Ctrl+B` bold, `Ctrl+I` italic on selected text (or inserts markers with cursor positioned inside)
- Settings panel
    - editor font family / size
    - Markdown view font family / size (independent; defaults to editor font)
    - text / background / heading colours
    - line-number gutter colour with live preview
    - configurable shortcuts (toggle Edit/Preview, collapse all, expand all)
- Find bar (works in both view and edit mode)
- Line numbers (text editor), configurable background colour (or auto-derived from theme)
- Smart editing — auto-pair `[]`/`()`, smart Enter continues list markers (plain lines use default newline), auto-renumbers ordered lists on deletion, Tab/Shift+Tab indent/dedent (4 spaces), full undo/redo (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y), URL-paste onto selected text creates a Markdown link
- **Image paste** (text editor) — paste an image from the clipboard and it is saved automatically as `assets/image-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.png` next to the open file; a `![image](assets/…)` link is inserted at the cursor
- **Keyboard navigation** (Markdown view) — `↑`/`↓` moves focus between paragraphs, headings, list items, code blocks, and blockquotes (focused element scrolls to centre); `→` expands a collapsed list parent; `←` collapses an open list parent
- **File link navigation** — write a standard Markdown link to any `.md` or `.txt` file (relative or absolute path); clicking it in Markdown view opens the file in a new Markitos window, cascaded 30 px from the current one
- Settings persisted immediately when the settings dialog is confirmed; window geometry saved on close (`~/.config/markitos/settings.json`)
- PyQt6 with `QWebEngineView` (Chromium) for full HTML5/CSS3 rendering

## LaTeX math

Uses [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) loaded from CDN. Works whenever the machine is online; when offline, `$...$` and `$$...$$` are shown as plain text without errors.

Examples:

This MD code:

```
Inline: The viscosity ranges from $0.7 \text{ to } 2.0 \text{ mPa}\cdot\text{s}$.

Display:
$$
E = mc^2
$$
```
is redered as:

Inline: The viscosity ranges from $0.7 \text{to} 2.0 \text{mPa}\cdot\text{s}$.

Display:

$$
E = mc^2
$$



Math expressions are protected from Markdown parsing before rendering, so underscores and asterisks inside `$...$` are treated as LaTeX, not Markdown emphasis.
